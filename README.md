# Heart Disease Prediction

This project is a machine learning model that predicts whether a person has heart disease or not based on their medical records. The model uses a logistic regression algorithm and achieves an accuracy of 86% on the test data.

## Motivation

Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, and early detection can save lives and improve health outcomes. This project aims to provide a simple and effective tool that can help doctors and patients assess the risk of heart disease and take preventive measures.

## Data

The data used for this project is from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease). It contains 303 records of patients with 14 attributes, such as age, sex, chest pain type, blood pressure, cholesterol level, etc. The target variable is the presence or absence of heart disease.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python 3 and the following libraries installed:
